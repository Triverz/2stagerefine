{"text": "Welsh AMs worried about 'looking like muppets'"}
{"text": "There is consternation among some AMs at a suggestion their title should change to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament)."}
{"text": "It has arisen because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament."}
{"text": "AMs across the political spectrum are worried it could invite ridicule."}
{"text": "One Labour AM said his group was concerned \"it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.\""}
{"text": "For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh twp means daft and pwp means poo."}
{"text": "A Plaid AM said the group as a whole was \"not happy\" and has suggested alternatives."}
{"text": "A Welsh Conservative said his group was \"open minded\" about the name change, but noted it was a short verbal hop from MWP to Muppet."}
{"text": "In this context The Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u."}
{"text": "The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: \"The final decision on any descriptors of what Assembly Members are called will of course be a matter for the members themselves.\""}
{"text": "The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name."}
{"text": "In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals which found broad support for calling the assembly a Welsh Parliament."}
{"text": "On the matter of the AMs' title, the Commission favoured Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a public consultation."}
{"text": "AMs are apparently suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes within weeks."}
{"text": "The legislation on the reforms will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system."}
{"text": "AMs will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called when they debate the legislation."}

{"text": "Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the \"Republic of North Macedonia.\""}
{"text": "The popular vote was set up in a bid to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia."}
{"text": "Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to its membership bids for the EU and NATO."}
{"text": "Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will disregard the vote."}
{"text": "However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO."}
{"text": "The Bells of St. Martin's Fall Silent as Churches in Harlem Struggle"}
{"text": "\"Historically, the old people I've talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,\" Mr. Adams said."}
{"text": "\"Today, there's neither.\""}
{"text": "He said the disappearance of bars was understandable."}
{"text": "\"People socialize in a different way\" nowadays, he said."}
{"text": "\"Bars are no longer neighborhood living rooms where people go on a regular basis.\""}
{"text": "As for churches, he worries that the money from selling assets will not last as long as leaders expect it to, \"and sooner or later they'll be right back where they started.\""}
{"text": "Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the neighborhood's remaining sanctuaries."}
{"text": "\"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,\" he said, \"and therefore will hasten the day that these churches close altogether because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.\""}
{"text": "Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later."}
{"text": "The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s."}
{"text": "A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby took title to the building."}
{"text": "St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting blacks."}
{"text": "A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild, they commissioned the carillon."}
{"text": "The Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon \"the poor people's bells.\""}
{"text": "The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: \"A cultural treasure\" and \"an irreplaceable historical instrument.\""}
{"text": "The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago."}
{"text": "Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him."}
{"text": "What has played out at St. Martin's over the last few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese."}
{"text": "The vestry - the parish's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese \"would seek to pass along the costs\" to the vestry, even though the vestry had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors the diocese sent in."}
{"text": "Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the diocese's part."}

{"text": "Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull him out of the water."}
{"text": "Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he \"realized that he was yelling, 'I got bit!"}
{"text": "I got bit!'"}
{"text": "His whole clavicle was ripped open,\" Hammel said he noticed once he got to the boy."}
{"text": "\"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'\" Hammel added."}
{"text": "The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is listed in critical condition."}
{"text": "The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown."}
{"text": "Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark."}
{"text": "Giles added the victim sustained traumatic injuries to his upper torso area."}
{"text": "Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes."}

{"text": "Sainsbury's is taking on Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style beauty aisles staffed with specialist assistants."}
{"text": "As part of a substantial push into the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which is continuing to grow while fashion and homeware sales fall back, the larger beauty aisles will be tested out in 11 stores around the country and taken to more stores next year if it proves a success."}
{"text": "The investment in beauty comes as supermarkets hunt for ways to use up shelf space once sued for TVs, microwaves and homeware."}
{"text": "Sainsbury's said it would be doubling the size of its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time."}
{"text": "Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those found in shops like Boots."}
{"text": "The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers."}
{"text": "In addition, perfume retailer the Fragrance Shop will be testing out concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week while a second opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year."}
{"text": "Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to visit."}
{"text": "Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, has said the outlets will look increasingly like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food."}
{"text": "Sainsbury's has been putting Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has bolstered grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable."}
{"text": "The supermarket's previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure."}
{"text": "Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a row over how to split the revenues from the chemist's stores in its supermarkets."}
{"text": "The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago."}
{"text": "It said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores."}
{"text": "Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: \"We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers."}
{"text": "We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be on hand to offer advice."}
{"text": "Our range of brands is designed to suit every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean we're now a compelling beauty destination which challenges the old way of shopping.\""}

{"text": "Holly Willoughby has left Dragons\" Den star Peter Jones fuming by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own new bumper contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV."}
{"text": "Sources say Jones was \"furious\" when TV's golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to devote to their homewear and accessories brand Truly."}
{"text": "The business had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune."}
{"text": "As Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce she was leaving Truly, Jones jetted out of Britain to head for one of his holiday homes."}

{"text": "Nobody could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the launch."}
{"text": "There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow HQ which are ready to be sold.\""}
{"text": "Experts believe the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the firm millions due to hefty investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homewear, and the potential for further delays to its launch."}
{"text": "And it could mean the end of a long friendship."}
{"text": "Mother-of-three Willoughby and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years."}
{"text": "Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March."}

{"text": "And he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim."}
{"text": "\"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right there,\" Trump said, pointing at the crowd directly in front of him."}

{"text": "From this year's recent exam results, we can see that languages are topping the league tables with the highest pass rates within independent schools."}
{"text": "A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages achieved a Higher grade A."}
{"text": "The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved a Higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French and 63 per cent studying Spanish also achieved an A."}
{"text": "This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly require in the future."}

{"text": "A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a languages skills shortage."}

{"text": "With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world."}

{"text": "Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition."}
{"text": "According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 per cent."}
{"text": "This is why putting the investment into language teaching now is important for today's children."}
{"text": "Having multiple languages, particularly those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful employment."}
{"text": "Within Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach."}
{"text": "A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, whereas others will teach languages that are deemed to be most important for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese."}
{"text": "Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this area."}

{"text": "North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its mistrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances."}
{"text": "Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken \"significant goodwill measures\" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology."}
{"text": "\"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.,\" he said."}
{"text": "\"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first.\""}
{"text": "While Ri reprised familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a \"phased\" approach to denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement appeared significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization out of hand as Pyongyang has done in the past."}
{"text": "Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first ever summit between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward \"denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\" while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea's security."}
{"text": "North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korea War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first."}
{"text": "Washington has also resisted calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea."}
{"text": "\"The U.S. insists on the \"denuclearization-first\" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting to the \"declaration of the end of war,\"\" Ri said."}
{"text": "\"The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us."}
{"text": "But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust.\""}
{"text": "Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week."}
{"text": "The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: \"If the party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the U.S., the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock.\""}
{"text": "Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after \"Mr Evil President\" Trump called Kim a \"rocket man\" on a suicide mission."}
{"text": "This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to \"totally destroy\" North Korea, heaped praise on Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes."}

{"text": "A new course at Harvard University this year has got all its undergraduates getting more sleep in a bid to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-fuelled 'all-nighters.'"}
{"text": "An academic found students at the world's number one university are often clueless when it comes to the very basics about how to look after themselves."}
{"text": "Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US."}
{"text": "He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact sleep deprivation had on learning."}
{"text": "'At the end of it one girl came up to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this now, in my senior year?'"}
{"text": "She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph."}
{"text": "The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their general wellbeing."}
{"text": "Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students were seriously sleep deprived during the week."}
{"text": "The hour long course involves a series of interactive tasks."}
{"text": "In one section there is an image of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is impacted by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine."}
{"text": "In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer."}
{"text": "A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine."}
{"text": "'We know it won't change students' behaviour instantly."}
{"text": "But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,' Prof Czeisler added."}
{"text": "The culture of pride in 'pulling an all-nighter' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a growing problem."}
{"text": "Ensuring you have enough sleep, of a good quality, should be a student's 'secret weapon' to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid putting on weight, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly hungry."}
{"text": "Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard."}
{"text": "He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course."}
{"text": "The next step, he hopes, it to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution."}
{"text": "Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can throw your circadian rhythm out of kilter, leading to problems falling asleep."}

{"text": "Rangers suffered another bout of away-day blues as Dolly Menga's strike consigned Steven Gerrard's disjointed side to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston."}
{"text": "The Ibrox side were looking to record their first win on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted just Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points adrift of runaway Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts."}
{"text": "Menga struck seven minutes before half-time and a Rangers line-up short on inspiration never looked like levelling."}
{"text": "While Rangers now drop down to sixth spot, Livingston climb to third and only behind Hibernian on goal difference."}
{"text": "And there could be further trouble in store for Rangers after linesman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end."}
{"text": "Gerrard made eight changes to the side which swept past Ayr into the Betfred Cup semi-finals."}
{"text": "Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 which took a point off Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-drilled outfit suffocated their opponents at every turn."}
{"text": "Rangers may have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had."}
{"text": "They should have scored just two minutes in when Menga's first-time lay-off sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder tugged his big chance wide."}
{"text": "A deep Keaghan Jacobs free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only stab wide at the back post."}
{"text": "Rangers did grab control but there looked to be more hope than belief about their play in the final third."}
{"text": "Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have had a penalty on the quarter-hour mark as he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's appeals."}
{"text": "Rangers managed just two first-half shots on target but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely troubled by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame Ovie Ejaria strike."}
{"text": "While Livi's 34th-minute opener may have been against the run of play, no one can deny they deserved it for their graft alone."}
{"text": "Again Rangers failed to deal with a deep Jacobs set-piece."}
{"text": "Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher slotted the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish."}
{"text": "Gerrard acted at the break as he swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the switch almost provided an immediate impact as the winger slotted in Morelos but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to block."}
{"text": "But Livingston continued to suck the visitors into playing exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long ball after long ball."}
{"text": "Holt's side could have stretched their lead in the final stages but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner."}
{"text": "Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty as he tangled with Jacobs but again Thomson looked away."}

{"text": "The Global Citizen Festival, which stated in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it."}
{"text": "In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or \"actions\" such volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty."}
{"text": "But just how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?"}
{"text": "Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called \"clicktivism\" - people feeling like they are making a true difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?"}
{"text": "Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million \"actions\" from its supporters, pushing for a host of different goals."}
{"text": "It says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equating to more than $37 billion that is set to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030."}
{"text": "In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from its actions, at least $10 billion of which have already been disbursed or fundraised."}
{"text": "The group estimates the secured funds have so far made a direct impact on nearly 649 million people across the world."}
{"text": "Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. based partnership of investors and implementers committed to \"helping children grow to their full potential,\" promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens."}
{"text": "\"With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,\" The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018."}
{"text": "The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken calling on the U.K. improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions."}
{"text": "In response to one of the FAQs on its website asking \"what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?\""}
{"text": "Global citizen replied: \"It'll be a long and hard path - sometimes we will fall and fail."}
{"text": "But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together."}
{"text": "Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the acts performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman."}
{"text": "US could use Navy for \"blockade\" to hamper Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary"}
{"text": "Washington can \"if necessary\" resort to its Navy to prevent Russian energy hitting the markets, including in the Middle East, US Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as cited by Washington Examiner."}
{"text": "Zinke alleged that Russia's engagement in Syria - notably, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext to explore new energy markets."}
{"text": "\"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is they want to broker energy just like they do in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe,\" he has reportedly said."}
{"text": "And, according to to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it."}
{"text": "\"The United States has that ability, with our Navy, to make sure the sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to make sure that their energy does not go to market,\" he said."}
{"text": "Zinke was addressing the attendees of the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group which styles itself as the \"voice of the energy consumer\" in the US."}
{"text": "He went to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same."}
{"text": "\"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, leveraging and replacing fuels,\" he said, while referring to Russia as a \"one trick pony\" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels."}
{"text": "The statements come as Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers."}
{"text": "For that effect, the Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to pull out of the \"inappropriate\" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, made Berlin Moscow's \"captive.\""}
{"text": "Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project."}
